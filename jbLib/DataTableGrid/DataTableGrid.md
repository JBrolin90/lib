# DataTableGrid

Kudos to @https://github.com/timunie who came up with the idea to wrap each cell and by that have a named binding even in an indexed scenario

Welcome to the DataTableGrid project! ðŸŽ‰

This C# project showcases a nifty DataGrid control using Avalonia UI, perfect for displaying and interacting with tabular data. The main goal here is to demonstrate different ways of binding data to the DataGrid, specifically focusing on named property and indexed property bindings.

Here's a quick rundown of what you'll find:

1. The project is centered around a custom data table component, with the core logic living in the `ViewModels` directory.
2. The user interface stuff is in the `Views` directory, keeping things nice and organized.
3. You'll see how to bind DataGrid columns to both named and indexed properties, and how these affect the DataGrid's behavior.

To get started, take a look at the `Program.cs` file - that's where the magic begins! Then, check out the `PeopleTable`, `ObservableDataRowCollection`, and `TableView` classes to see how they work together.

The project structure is clean and straightforward, making it easy to navigate and understand. Feel free to explore the different files and see how they contribute to the overall functionality.

If you're ready to dive in and contribute, consider:
1. Experimenting with different binding approaches
2. Adding new features to the DataGrid
3. Improving the existing code or documentation

Remember, this project is all about learning and demonstrating cool DataGrid techniques. Have fun exploring, and happy coding! ðŸ˜Š



## Project Overview

The DataTableGrid project consists of the following main components:

1. `DataTableGridView`: The class encapsulates the complexity of setting up a DataGrid for a DataTable.
2. `ObservableDataTable`: Serves as a crucial bridge between the raw data stored in a standard DataTable and the observable collection needed for responsive UI.
3. `ObservableDataRow Class`: Encapsulates a single row of data from the DataTable, providing a more object-oriented and observable interface to the row's data.
4. `ObservableDataCell`: Represents an individual cell within an ObservableDataRow as an Observable cell

## 1. DataTableGridView Class
DataTableGridViewClass
The DataTableGridView class is a custom control that wraps and enhances the functionality of a standard DataGrid control for displaying tabular data. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and key features:

1.Data Binding:
The class takes a DataTable as input and creates an ObservableDataTable from it. This ObservableDataTable is then used as the ItemsSource for the DataGrid, enabling dynamic updates and two-way binding.
2.Automatic Column Generation:
The BuildDataGridColumns method automatically generates DataGridTextColumns based on the columns in the ObservableDataTable. This saves time and effort in manually defining columns for each DataTable.
3.Customization:
It allows for easy customization of column headers and bindings. The column header uses the Caption of the DataColumn if available, otherwise falling back to the ColumnName.
4.Flexibility:
By using indexed property binding ($"[{column.Ordinal}].Value"), it provides a flexible way to bind to data cells, regardless of their position in the table.
5.Encapsulation:
The class encapsulates the complexity of setting up a DataGrid for a DataTable, providing a simple interface for developers to use.
6.Reusability:
This class can be easily reused across different parts of the application wherever a DataTable needs to be displayed in a grid format.


In essence, the DataTableGridView class serves as a bridge between raw data (in the form of a DataTable) and a user-friendly, interactive grid display. It simplifies the process of presenting tabular data in a UI, handling the intricacies of data binding and column generation behind the scenes.

## 2. ObservableDataTable Class

The ObservableDataTable class serves as a crucial bridge between the raw data stored in a standard DataTable and the observable collection needed for responsive UI binding in Avalonia. Here are its key purposes:

1.Data Wrapping: It wraps a standard System.Data.DataTable, providing an observable interface to its data. This allows the UI to react to changes in the underlying data.
2.Observable Collection Functionality: By implementing IEnumerable, it allows the DataGrid to treat it as a collection of rows, each of which can notify the UI of changes.
3.Indexer Access: The class provides an indexer (this[int index]) that returns ObservableDataRow objects, allowing easy access to specific rows.
4.Column Information: It exposes the Columns property from the underlying DataTable, which is used for generating DataGrid columns dynamically.
5.Data Transformation: When constructed, it transforms each DataRow in the original DataTable into an ObservableDataRow. This transformation is key to enabling reactive UI updates.
6.Bridging Data and UI: It acts as an intermediary between the data layer (DataTable) and the UI layer (DataGrid), encapsulating the complexity of making a DataTable observable.
7.Facilitating Indexed Binding: By wrapping each DataRow in an ObservableDataRow, it enables the indexed property binding ([{column.Ordinal}].Value) used in the DataTableGridView.

In essence, the ObservableDataTable is a crucial component that enables the project's goal of demonstrating different binding approaches (named and indexed) with a DataGrid. It transforms the static data of a DataTable into a dynamic, observable format that can seamlessly interact with Avalonia's data binding system, allowing for responsive and interactive data displays in the UI.

## 3. ObservableDataRow Class
The ObservableDataRow class is a crucial component in the DataTableGrid project, serving as a wrapper for individual DataRow objects from the original DataTable. Here are its key purposes:

1.Data Encapsulation: It encapsulates a single row of data from the DataTable, providing a more object-oriented and observable interface to the row's data.
2.Observable Properties: By implementing INotifyPropertyChanged (implied by the context), it allows the UI to react to changes in individual cell values within the row.
3.Indexed Access: The class provides an indexer (this[int index]) that allows access to individual cells within the row using their column index.
4.Data Transformation: When constructed, it transforms each cell in the DataRow into an ObservableDataCell. This transformation is key to enabling reactive UI updates at the cell level.
5.UI-Data Synchronization: It acts as an intermediary between the data layer (DataRow) and the UI layer (DataGrid row), ensuring that changes in either direction are properly propagated.
6.Facilitating Binding: By wrapping each cell in an ObservableDataCell, it enables both named property binding (e.g., Name and Age) and indexed property binding (e.g., [0] and [1]) used in the DataGrid.
7.Collection Element: It serves as the element type for the ObservableDataTable collection, allowing the DataGrid to work with a collection of observable rows.

In essence, the ObservableDataRow class is a vital component in transforming static DataRow objects into dynamic, observable entities that can seamlessly interact with Avalonia's data binding system. It enables the project to demonstrate different binding approaches (named and indexed) with a DataGrid, allowing for responsive and interactive data displays in the UI at the row level.

This class works in tandem with ObservableDataTable and ObservableDataCell to provide a comprehensive solution for making DataTable data fully observable and bindable in an Avalonia UI context.

## 4. ObservableDataCell Class
The ObservableDataCell class is a crucial component in the DataTableGrid project that represents an individual cell within an ObservableDataRow. Its main purposes are:

1.Data Encapsulation: It encapsulates a single cell's data from the DataRow, providing a more object-oriented and observable interface to the cell's value.
2.Observable Property: By implementing INotifyPropertyChanged (as evidenced in the snippets), it allows the UI to react to changes in the cell's value.
3.Two-way Binding: It provides a Value property with both getter and setter, enabling two-way data binding between the UI and the underlying DataRow.
4.Data Validation: The class can potentially implement data validation logic when setting new values to ensure data integrity.
5.Read-only State Management: It exposes an IsReadOnly property, which can be used to control whether the cell can be edited in the UI.
6.Event Handling: It handles the Table_ColumnChanged event, which allows it to respond to changes in the underlying DataTable and propagate those changes to the UI.
7.UI-Data Synchronization: It acts as an intermediary between the data layer (DataRow and DataColumn) and the UI layer (DataGrid cell), ensuring that changes in either direction are properly propagated.
8.Facilitating Binding: By providing a Value property, it enables both named property binding and indexed property binding used in the DataGrid.

In essence, the ObservableDataCell class is a vital component in transforming static cell data from a DataTable into dynamic, observable entities that can seamlessly interact with Avalonia's data binding system. It works in conjunction with ObservableDataRow and ObservableDataTable to provide a comprehensive solution for making DataTable data fully observable and bindable in an Avalonia UI context.

This class is key to enabling the project's goal of demonstrating different binding approaches (named and indexed) with a DataGrid, allowing for responsive and interactive data displays in the UI at the individual cell level.


## Key Features

- Binding DataGrid columns to named properties 
- Binding DataGrid columns to indexed properties, facilating dynamic binding
- Demonstration of two-way binding behavior
- Customizable DataGrid setup

## Binding Behavior

The project demonstrates two different binding approaches:

1. **Named Property Binding**: 
   - Columns bound to `Name` and `Age` properties
   - Responds correctly to PropertyChanged events
   - DataGrid automatically sets IsReadOnly based on the IList.IsReadOnly property

2. **Indexed Property Binding**:
   - Columns bound to `[0]` and `[1]` indexed properties
   - Responds correctly to PropertyChanged events
   - DataGrid automatically sets IsReadOnly based on the IList.IsReadOnly property

## Usage


To use the DataTableGridView control in your project, follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have a DataTable that you want to display. This could be created programmatically or loaded from a data source.

2. Create an instance of the DataTableGridView, passing your DataTable to its constructor:

   ```csharp
   DataTable myDataTable = // ... your DataTable creation or loading logic
   DataTableGridView gridView = new DataTableGridView(myDataTable);
   ```

3. The DataTableGridView will automatically set up the DataGrid with columns based on your DataTable structure. It uses the ObservableDataTable internally to wrap your DataTable and make it observable.

4. You can now use this gridView in your Avalonia UI. For example, you might set it as the Content of a Window or add it to a parent control:

   ```csharp
   // If using it directly in a Window
   this.Content = gridView;

   // Or if adding to another control
   parentControl.Children.Add(gridView);
   ```

5. The DataTableGridView handles the column generation automatically. It will create columns based on the DataTable structure, using the column names as headers.

6. The control uses indexed property binding internally (`[{column.Ordinal}].Value`), which allows for flexible and dynamic binding regardless of the column position in the table.

7. You don't need to manually set up bindings or create columns - the DataTableGridView handles this for you based on the DataTable structure.

8. The resulting grid will support two-way binding, meaning changes in the UI will be reflected in the underlying DataTable, and vice versa.

Here's a complete example of how you might use it in a Window class:

```csharp
public class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        
        // Create or load your DataTable
        DataTable myDataTable = CreateSampleDataTable();

        // Create the DataTableGridView
        DataTableGridView gridView = new DataTableGridView(myDataTable);

        // Set it as the content of the window
        this.Content = gridView;
    }

    private DataTable CreateSampleDataTable()
    {
        DataTable table = new DataTable();
        table.Columns.Add("Name", typeof(string));
        table.Columns.Add("Age", typeof(int));
        table.Rows.Add("Alice", 30);
        table.Rows.Add("Bob", 25);
        return table;
    }
}
```

This approach encapsulates the complexity of setting up a DataGrid for a DataTable, providing a simple interface for developers to use. The DataTableGridView handles the creation of the ObservableDataTable, sets up the necessary bindings, and manages the column generation, making it easy to display and interact with tabular data in your Avalonia UI application.
